Many libraries assist with literacy training, host book clubs, provide after school activities for children, give senior citizens on fixed incomes a place to borrow books they otherwise could not afford to read. Many libraries do dual duty as de facto community centers. Using the internet at home to do research is fine, Wikipedia is not a peer reviewed source that is accepted as a reference for many schools and universities.

He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them.

A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

If a cat is going to be exclusively an indoor kitty, and the alternative is the destruction of most of your furniture, then this seems a reasonable choice to me as a last resort. My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever.

They used to provide the final word. Now more often then not if they do their job right they are at best conversation starters. And what a conversation it has become, I often can't wait to get to the comments after reading an article eager to sift through the non sequiturs and sophomoric sonambulism to find the real analytical gems so often to be found there.

"In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is. Judge Ginsburg has given 40-50% of the people every reason to write her off, which ultimately just hurts the institution.",election,AGAINST,1

It was planned meticulously to meet twenty-first century needs, integrating technology and print. Eight years hence the library remains a campus focal point. Additional space has been provided for student seating as well as for technology-related projects. To my way of thinking, libraries and books remain fundamental to learning.

How about, ""There is absolutely no justification for the shooting of Walter Scott, period."" Add to that officers lying about the murder and only being exposed because a brave citizen filmed the murder. Mr. Glennon, do you support prosecuting the officer[s] involved in the cover up for obstruction of justice? Should they also go to prison for lying and covering up the evidence? Mr. Clennon, do you support mandatory reporting of all police shootings? How can you make any claims about the use of deadly force when no police force is required to even report when a shooting takes place? Had the person filming the murder been just an eyewitness without a camera, his testimony would have been discredited by officers and prosecutors covering for the officer who murdered this victim.

Otherwise many will read something with no discussion and think the article is valid, when it's not. People often feel connected to an article and take it personally when something needs to be stated in a more clear fashion. I have often learned things from comment sections that added value or clarified issues that were not address in the article but should have been. The solution for bigotry and vitriol is not taking the voice from people. Censorship should never be allowed. There are several way to address this issue when it comes to forums.

Comment sections usually bring out pertinent points and perspectives that the author omits. 3) It is important, especially for social and politics issues to understand not only the content of an article but what the opinion of the public is toward the article that can be particularly important, and more relevant than any poll. 4) The internet is, by nature, interactive. If you present topics of current interest and don't give people the ability to interact with them, people will go elsewhere to where they can. 5) Most people want to have a discussion about issues that of importance to them, few simply want to sit and be lectured to.",comment section,FAVOR,1

"Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible. The library and information sector plays an important role in providing public access to networked information. Public libraries worldwide are a significant component; by ensuring that there is equity in access to information (for both educational and recreational purposes) through the provision of quality library services for all citizens.",library,FAVOR,1

However, I also want to add that a place with books, whether it is my house or a library, is a vital resource that brings benefits not to be found on the Internet (I am a technologist, by the way). Our local library was been closed for a couple of years for a major renovation and to save money (no good alternative was offered or created in the community). Not having a library is like losing the heart of the community. I find libraries superior to the Internet for what most people believe they get best online: random access to information and facts. Online, I don't come across things for which I am not searching. In a library, it is all there before me, waiting. Just walking through the reference room can lead to unexpected discoveries, diversions and, on occasion, new directions. We need both books and electronic information.

"Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups. As access to steadily growing amounts of information becomes more important for all members of society perhaps the role and services of libraries might actually increase rather than decline.",library,FAVOR,1

"When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them.

No - because the consumption of women, as flesh and blood drug, is a form of cannibalism. Not all of us against prostitution are of the 'Christian majorities' - some of us survived serial killers and are trying to get a word out. Imagine that.",prostitution,AGAINST,1
"While I understand the desire to protect those addicted to gambling, the simple truth is that gambling addicts are already gambling online, without any oversight or regulation. The illegality of it isn't stopping that. Legalization would bring a huge underground industry into the open. Furthermore, the negative opinions make it sound like every computer in America will be wired into an online casino. School and workplace computers will certainly not be able to do that without detection by supervisors, and parents can keep their kids away by making sure they don't have access to credit cards. The simple fact is that millions of Americans enjoy gambling and do so responsibly. If we're going to keep it illegal because a small minority can't control themselves, then I guess we better get busy outlawing alcohol, tobacco, and fast food too.",internet gambling,FAVOR,1

The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now?

"I comment reasonably frequently and also read a lot more than I would otherwise because of the comments. Mostly I feel the Times does a decent job moderating the comments, although I often notice the same pro-Hillary bias in many of the NYT picks as opposed to the Reader's Picks. (Anecdotally, this bias in the picks seems to be diminishing.) I also agree that many commenters are predictable, but because of their status, make it to the front of the line. I wonder if more courageous columnists might be willing to directly take on points that commenters raise. I feel that there is an awful lot of repetition of memes by columnists that have been discredited, such as Sanders's supposed pro-gun positions, when in fact he has a D minus rating from the NRA. Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them.

Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence; it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests?

They police-escort the person across the hallway to the Psychiatric emergency room; force strip the person; ship the person to WestChester in-patient for six days against the person's will; taking all the regularly-prescribed medicine away while declaring the person bi-polar which the person is not; Then tell the person they are free to find a way back to New York City, turning the person loose without the long-standing legitimate prescriptions.

"This entire conversation gives me heartburn. I am a college teacher who, yes, has entries on Rate My Professor and who works for a college that overtly cites the website when lauding the success of its best teachers. So I pay attention to the public discussions of student evaluations. The heartburn comes not from fear that my rating index is too low but rather in the assumptions of both sides. The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites. As mentioned by at least one commenter, ratings suffer from selection bias and from a failure to use common terms. Those with strong opinions for or against are more likely to evaluate an instructor and what raters see as strict or smart or easy or dumb is so subjective that any two raters may have opposite definitions of the same word used in a rating. Not a good combination: an unrepresentative sample using uncommon terms to rate a product.",rate professor,AGAINST,0

This country allowed insurance companies to corner the market on healthcare via insurance, to price medical treatment beyond the range of any individual to pay without insurance, and therefore to deny care and coverage to anyone with impunity. Obama has restored the balance by taking away the insurance companies' ability to block consumers from receiving medical care. He did it without the social violence that, by rights, should have accompanied such a revolutionary change. Obama actually initiated a return of healthcare to a free market, competitive status.

The writer's premise that anonymity produces bad ideas and vulgar expression appears highly doubtful. I submit that the quality of the idea being discussed is the only thing that matters, and that there will never be a consensus on that evaluation. If quality is too low (as in the bulk of what appears on Twitter), individuals are free to consider the idea poor or the manner of expression deficient.

We develop a reading list of the books shared each year, and let kids know they have access to them all through our local library. For communities in which books are an unaffordable luxury, libraries level the playing field, giving access to unlimited literary riches to all. In our community, they also provide much needed parenting help through story times and reading activities for caregivers and young children every week. Many families without computers at home get access to the internet at the library for homework help, employment and tax information. While libraries may be redundant for more affluent families, they provide a window into a different present and future for those of lesser means.",library,FAVOR,1

One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors.

That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time.

In other words, the more students dislike a professor, the better those students do in similar classes down the road. Why? Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

The courts could strike it down, I suppose, but it's far from clear that they should, and their decision would have to explain some interesting contradictions between their position and contradictory aspects of past immigration laws.

Their juxtaposition had me thinking about the need for both several times throughout the day, and I concluded that the audio system would do just fine on its own -- so long as the participants are reminded to speak clearly enough for recording. There were times when I was pretty sure that the judge was relying on the court reporter's good sense of hearing to make a complete transcript and may not herself have heard everything that was said. So, even if court reporters are someday replaced by recording devises, they may still be needed to act as recoding engineers of sorts to ensure a faithful transcription.",court stenographer,FAVOR,0

Rate my Professor is essentially an internet scam to generate site traffic. I am sorry to see it getting this kind of free publicity in a serious paper like the NYT. Rate my Professor is a for-profit site. You can even post a review of someone without ever having taken a class with that person or on a class that the professor never taught. Try it.

Within about 15 minutes of the story being released, commenters were putting up links to stories about Bernie Sanders visiting New York's public housing projects about 10 hours earlier, a rebuttal that many readers might have been unaware of had the comment section not existed. And the New York Times' centralized moderation system isn't the only way to get real legitimate debate going, with evidence and logic being thrown around (along with the occasional entertainment like parody song lyrics or poetry).",comment section,FAVOR,1

"The CIA reminds me by its recent actions of the old joke, ""Military Intelligence is a contradiction in terms."" To the extent that the CIA has become militarized and lawless, (which is the real reason that the prison at Guantanemo was established, so that torture could take place without the oversight of U.S. law) it has become a detriment to the nation, and a blot on the United States' reputation. We should disband the CIA and assign its responsibilities to civilians who will obey the laws and understand the consequences of covert actions to our foreign relations. The State Department should be well up to the task. Faulty intelligence leads to lost wars and continual embarrassment for the politicians who rely on it. The CIA should have no ties to the Department of Defense, so that operations can be unfettered by a military mindset.",c.i.a,AGAINST,0
"Glad Ms Grace is no longer associated with the Medicaid Commission. But as her credentials for this debate include ""free market ideas for health care reform"", its interesting that she doesn't offer any. Must be one of those ""social welfare"" groups organized to attract tax deductible funds for GOP causes. The Manhattan study focuses only on premiums and not total HC cost. Since the actuarial value is increasing from 45% today to 80% (% of premiums paid in claims) in the individual market, its going to be a better deal by definition. Mr. Roy forgot to mention that. The young male premiums before subsidy go up so much because they are offsetting higher premiums traditionally paid by women in the ""free market"" because they have babies, even though it usually takes two. And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare. So what's a young high income male without insurance to do (not many of these, BTW) to reduce their premiums? They can buy catastrophic coverage for a small amount to cover major expenses, just as before.",obamacare,AGAINST,1

As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all.

I've always preferred the term ""writer about . . ."" to ""critic"" or ""reviewer"" (as in ""writer about movies or ""writer about dance""). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few. Unlike the casual opinionators who crowd the Internet, the best professional critics become longtime companions - passionate, prickly friends with whom one can agree, laugh and argue over many shared experiences.",medical care,NONE,1

"Biology plays a role in an individual's perception of how salty something tastes. If a chef insists on making the decision of how to properly salt a dish, then some will perceive it as over salted and some as under salted. It's a lot easier to add more salt than to remove salt from food. I always prefer a restaurant to go easy on the salt, and allow me to add what I feel is necessary for my tastes. Otherwise a number of diners are forced into eating food that they might enjoy more, if allowed to have input on how it's salted.",polling,NONE,0

"Our kids are addicted to screens: facebook, texting, video games, TV-- Their parents often work, and the evening is too often a time when each weary family member retreats to his or her screen of choice. Human interaction, the ability to deal with conflict, the necessity to adapt to people who are different from oneself, not responsive at the push of a button, and essential to the development of real social skills, becomes less and less for these kids--and for us adults, too. This lack manifests itself in a cut-off relationship with other people, indifference to neighbors, absence of the learning that generations have formerly passed on to the young--societal coldness and narcissism abound. And a terrible need to be heard, and seen, and cared for by real human beings is rampant among the young. This is Facebook's appeal; the young people are crying out, ""See me! Here I am!"" in a world that seems to want to farm them out to machines and programmed experiences.

Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't. It is a factor that should not even be considered by most voters. They should vote for the person they want to win, period.",food label,NONE,1

Especially when I came back as a 26-yr old to live in a graduate dorm for a year, it was a huge relief to let someone else cook, and just show up to eat.

"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

It missed the 9/11 attack; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence; it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests?

"I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.",medical care,NONE,1

Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.""

Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce.

""We found crop yields to be 20% lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs."" With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce. Produce grown in biologically active soil, which is achieved using organic soil building methods, does have more testable ultra-trace minerals. Scientists are only now understanding how important these minerals are to human health. The holes in Christie Wilcox's argument are far and wide.",internet addiction,NONE,0

"The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality. If you insist on sacrificing yourself on this altar to show ethnic solidarity, don't be surprised when people conclude that Islam is still stuck in the past.

Coming from a disadvantaged background, I was simply unable afford to take on unpaid work during and after college, regardless of how much it might have helped my future career to do so. Thus I was at a disadvantage compared to peers at my college. This doesn't really sound like a level playing field, does it??? One additional point: The emphasis on internship experience on resumes allows employers an easy way to ascertain which candidates are likely to come from wealthier backgrounds...making it easier for employees to discriminate in terms of social class and race (since certain races are more likely to be represented in the disadvantaged group). Not fair. And we wonder why there are no jobs out there? Employers are filling lots of them for free.",hijab,NONE,1

If Germany exits, the resulting depression will once again bring to the fore the ultra nationalists in many states and no one can predict the resultant chaos that will inevitably follow. For the time being germany ie well trapped in the euro until the crisis ebbs and then the argument to separate may in all probability ebb away also",salt,NONE,1

"The new Greek govt must do 2 things. One is to negotiate a decrease (or restructuring to longer payment terms) of its debt. That is the immediate problem. The new Govt. may or may not be able to do this. That will depend on how the negotiations go with the creditors. Simultaneously, and very importantly however, Greece must undergo serious economic reforms. For example the creation of a land registry, a stop to political vote buying by politicians, a stop to corruption, the creation of an apolitical statistical service, a non-pollitcal civil servant based on merit instead of cronyism, etc. Does the new Govt show any signs of this (beyond rheteric)? Absolutely not. There are no signs that a land registry will be created, that merit will be the basis of a civil service, that a non-political statistical service will be created or that an effective tax collection agency will be set up. Hence this latter task will not be accomplished.",home schoolers,NONE,1

"When did having 75% of the students passing a course with a C or better become a good thing? I think that a 75% passing rate is not good.

I've taken online courses and they were not well designed, flexible, or conducive to having a discussion. This holds true for a set of courses I took 5 years ago and for several I've taken in the last year. Having an on line course available in conjunction with a live course would be great.

"I learned cursive in grade school back in the 80's and I haven't stopped using it since. It's a skill I am grateful I have. As kids, we took pride in our handwriting...today...I don't think kids know what a pen is. That's sad. I look at some handwriting from pretty high level professionals and it's atrocious. People don't even write whole words anymore. To me, this speaks to standards, which I believe were effectively lowered forever when spellcheck was invented. Soon the question will be asked...do children need to write at all...can't they just text the answers to their teachers? I, for one, look forward to the beautifully handwritten notes I get from friends and remember them much more than emails and text messages. Please, let's not lower the standards on handwriting too.",pesticide,NONE,0
